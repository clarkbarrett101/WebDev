        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>A movie I watched just a week ago but one of my new favorite movies.  Taking place in the "Predator"(1987) universe, the movie follows
            a young Native American woman in the year 1719. Her tribe doesn't respect her as a hunter because she doesn't have the physical strength 
            of the other hunters.  When the Predator alien attacks the tribe the other hunters try to overpower the alien with brute force
            but don't stand a chance.  She must use her resourcefulness and creative thinking to outsmart the alien and save her tribe.
